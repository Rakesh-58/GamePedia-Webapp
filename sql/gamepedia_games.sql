For his entire life, Basim has been haunted by visions of a monstrous jinni, which Nehal had been helping him cope with. While just a simple thief, Basim has greater aspirations and attempts to join the Hidden Ones, but is flatly rejected by the senior Hidden One stationed in Anbar, Roshan bint-La\'Ahad. In an effort to prove himself, Basim sneaks into the Caliph\'s palace to steal a chest sought by both the Hidden Ones and the Order of the Ancients. Basim retrieves a disk-shaped artifact from the chest, which displays a holographic message, before he is confronted by the Caliph, al-Mutawakkil. Nehal kills the Caliph to save Basim and they both flee the palace.@In retaliation for the Caliph\'s murder, the guards begin slaughtering all thieves in Anbar, including many of Basim\'s friends, and he angrily blames Nehal before parting ways. Now on the run, Basim manages to escape the city with Roshan\'s help, and she takes him to the Hidden Ones\' mountain fortress at Alamut. Over the next few years, Basim trains under Roshan and is eventually initiated into the Hidden Ones. When their Mentor, Rayhan, learns of the Order\'s rapidly expanding influence in Baghdad, he decides to send a contingent of Hidden Ones to the city to investigate, led by Basim and Roshan.@Upon arriving in Baghdad, Basim learns that five Order members have infiltrated the Caliphate\'s highest levels of power, and are exploiting it in order to excavate or rebuild ancient Isu artifacts. He proceeds to hunt down four of the Order members, assassinating them and their subordinates and foiling their respective plots. During this time, Basim reunites with Nehal, who is distrustful of the Hidden Ones and encourages Basim to investigate the artifacts the Order is looking for, believing they are both somehow linked to them. Eventually, Basim confronts the Order\'s leader, Qabiha, who claims that the answers he seeks lie in an Isu temple underneath Alamut. Qabiha then tries to convince Basim to accompany her to the temple, but is killed by Roshan, who warns Basim not to investigate any further.@Disobeying Roshan, Basim travels to Alamut with Nehal, only to find the fortress under siege by the Order\'s forces. Basim rescues many captured Hidden Ones and rallies them to fight off the attack while he heads to the temple after convincing Rayhan that the power held within could be used to defeat the Order for good. However, he is confronted by Roshan, who reveals that she is aware of Basim\'s true nature and attempts to stop him from entering the temple, fearing what it may awaken within Basim. Basim defeats Roshan, but spares her life and enters the temple with Nehal. Inside, he finds more disk-shaped artifacts[c] and discovers that the temple used to be a prison where the Isu Loki was held in at some point before escaping. Basim also realizes that Nehal never existed; both she and the jinni were in fact representations of his repressed memories as Loki. Deciding to embrace his nature as Loki\'s reincarnation, Basim \"fuses\" with Nehal and regains his memories.@Upon leaving the temple, Basim is welcomed back into the Hidden Ones, which causes Roshan to resign in protest. Now fully aware of his past life as Loki, Basim muses that he has been reborn in a new world, and looks forward to a \"reunion\" with those who were responsible for his imprisonment.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMV4rEb0F3o'),('daysgone','Days Gone','A virus has decimated the globe, turning a large portion of humanity into violent zombie-like creatures called Freakers. In Oregon, outlaw bikers Deacon St. John (Sam Witwer) and William \"Boozer\" Gray (Jim Pirri), alongside Deacon\'s wife Sarah Whitaker (Courtnee Draper), attempt to flee to safety. They find a NERO helicopter that has room for two more occupants. While Sarah boards the helicopter, Boozer is injured and Deacon stays behind to help him after promising to reunite with his wife.@Two years later, Deacon and Boozer are working in the Pacific Northwest as mercenaries. Sarah is assumed dead because the NERO refugee camp she was believed to have been staying in was overrun by Freakers. The two men plan to head north in search of a better life, but they are attacked by a gang of cultists, the Rippers. Boozer\'s arm is burned in the attack and Deacon searches for medical supplies to help him recover. Later, the two learn that the Rippers have placed a bounty on their heads. Deacon sees a NERO helicopter and follows it, eventually meeting James O\'Brian (Bernardo de Paula), the researcher who evacuated Sarah two years earlier. O\'Brian reveals that Sarah\'s helicopter was diverted to a different camp mid-flight, leaving the possibility that she is still alive.@While running errands for Ada Tucker (Dee Dee Rescher), the leader of the Hot Springs Camp, Deacon finds Lisa Jackson (Laura Bailey & Alexa Rose), a teenage girl and returns her to Tucker. Lisa later flees the Hot Spring after being subjected to forced labour under Tucker\'s regime and is captured and tortured by the Rippers, forcing Deacon to rescue her. Unwilling to send Lisa back to the Hot Springs, Deacon arranges for her to shelter with Rikki Patil (Nishi Munshi), a former drifter and member of the Lost Lake camp led by \"Iron\" Mike Wilcox (Eric Allan Kramer) and Raymond \"Skizzo\" Sarkozi (Jason Spisak), the former of which parted on bad terms with Deacon over his violent behaviour and dubious morals.@Boozer\'s condition worsens and, in an act of desperation, Deacon sneaks into Lost Lake to steal medical supplies but is caught. Despite the bad blood, Deacon is able to convince Iron Mike to allow Boozer to stay and later learns that Lisa fled from the camp and remains missing. As a doctor amputates Boozer\'s gangrenous arm, O\'Brian contacts Deacon and offers to help him find Sarah if Deacon aids him in NERO\'s ongoing research project. Skizzo is distrustful of the Rippers\' uneasy alliance with Lost Lake; he makes his own deal and turns Deacon over to the cult. Deacon discovers that the Rippers\' leader \"Carlos\" is actually Jessie Williamson (Scott Whyte), a former member of Deacon and Boozer\'s MC who blames the pair for his branding and subsequent excommunication after Jessie killed another member in a drug-fueled rage. Discovered and freed by Lisa, who has since joined the Rippers, Deacon escapes from the Rippers\' camp and returns to Lost Lake only to find it under attack by Jessie and the Rippers. Deacon exposes Skizzo\'s betrayal to Iron Mike, and Iron Mike talks down Jessie, ending the attack. Skizzo is arrested. With Boozer\'s help, Deacon uses explosives to destroy the dam above the Rippers\' camp, flooding the compound and drowning most of the Rippers while Deacon kills Jessie in single combat. After Deacon returns, Iron Mike reveals he released Skizzo to spare his life.@Deacon realizes that Sarah, a government researcher with federal security clearance, would have been prioritized during a camp evacuation, and O\'Brian confirms that she was moved to a military outpost at Crater Lake, which is now controlled by the Deschutes County Militia. He warns Deacon that the Freakers are rapidly evolving and becoming more dangerous. Deacon meets Derrick Kouri (Phil Morris), a Captain for the militia wearing Sarah\'s Mongrels ring, and is brought back to the Crater Lake outpost. Deacon then wins over the militia\'s leader, Colonel Matthew Garret (Daniel Riordan) and reunites with Sarah, who is working to create a bio-weapon to destroy the Freakers. Deacon and Sarah decide to obtain a DNA sequencer at her old lab, where they discover that her research was used to develop the Freaker virus, unbeknownst to either of them.@At the lab, Sarah reveals that she is working to cure the Freakers rather than destroy them. Deacon suggests they finish the cure at her new lab, but an increasingly paranoid Garret puts Sarah into protective custody. Garret, shown over time to be a religious fanatic, reveals that he believes other human factions are a bigger danger than the Freakers, and declares a holy war against all other camps. Deacon attempts to save Sarah but is caught and arrested by Skizzo, who has joined the militia and lies that Deacon was a murderer outcast from their last camp. Although Garret orders his execution, Deacon is spared and released by a sympathetic Kouri, who defects from the militia. Returning to Lost Lake just in time to assist in the defense against the militia attack, Deacon finds a mortally wounded Iron Mike who dies shortly after. Deacon rallies the remaining members of the Lost Lake camp, as well as the members of the nearby settlements, to retaliate against the militia by attacking their headquarters with a truck bomb. Deacon kills Skizzo and Sarah poisons Garret, ending the militia. Deacon, Sarah, Boozer and their friends settle at Lost Lake, and Lisa is revealed to have become a drifter collecting Freaker bounties.@In a post-credits scene, O\'Brian contacts Deacon for a face-to-face meeting and reveals that NERO always knew about the virus\'s mutagenic effects, and that O\'Brian himself is a unique kind of Freaker, mutated but still in control of his thoughts and actions. He warns Deacon that NERO is coming and that nothing will stop them, before leaving Oregon via helicopter.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/99NfMJFaG1Y'),('forza','Forza Horizon 5','Forza Horizon 5 is a racing video game set in an open world environment based in a fictional representation of Mexico.The game has the largest map in the entire Forza Horizon series, being 50% larger than its predecessor, Forza Horizon 4, while also having the highest point in the Horizon series.The map was described by creative director Mike Brown as one of the most diverse Forza Horizon maps the team has built.The map contains an active caldera volcano, jungles and beaches, ancient Mayan temples, and towns and cities such as Guanajuato. Players can explore the open world freely, though they can also compete in multiplayer races and complete the campaign mode. Both the cars featured in the game and the player character can be extensively customised. Players are able to create custom liveries and tunes for cars, and perform engine swaps, drivetrain swaps, or install body kits on certain vehicles. The game is the first in the franchise to support ray tracing on cars (although this is only available in Forzavista).@The game introduces a new weather system (local weather) in which players can visit one side of the map and can visibly see a storm. Because Mexico is such a vast nation with such a wide range of elevations, multiple climates would appear in the game at around the same time. The four seasons still exist but would affect the eleven unique biomes around the map. For example, in the dry season, dust storms will appear, while tropical storms occur throughout the fall storm season. Another detail is in the jungle, in which the environment would now react to the weather; an example of this is leaves flying everywhere.@Forza Horizon 5 also introduces a brand new Horizon Arcade. This consists of a series of mini-multiplayer games strewn across the map. One of these mini-multiplayer games is called \"Piñata pop\" where the Horizon Festival\'s cargo plane drops piñatas. The goal is to pop as many piñatas as they can with the help of other players. It also introduces the \"EventLab\", a toolset in which players can create custom games, races, and more depending on their personal preference. A new feature called \"Forza Link\" was introduced. According to Brown, it is an AI assistant that tracks the current statuses of players, helping them to link with other players online and play together. Forza Link can also link players\' GPS systems if they accept the invitation from another player. Accolades, new to the Forza Horizon series, allow players to collect points and prizes for completing certain tasks. Some vehicles can only be unlocked through the completion of the Accolades. There are over 1,800 accolades for the player to achieve.@The Eliminator battle royale game mode introduced in Forza Horizon 4 returns, albeit with players starting in a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle rather than a 1965 Mini. The world is designed for the mode unlike the previous game, which received The Eliminator after launch. As in the previous game, players can buy in-game houses ranging from small beachside cabanas to even a hotel, which can unlock rewards such as Wheelspins and the right to Fast Travel. The game features over 800 licensed vehicles.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCV6rNvm2nk'),('godofwar','God Of War: Ragnork','Near the end of Fimbulwinter, Kratos and Atreus return home—fending off an ambush from a vengeful Freya—to find their wolf Fenrir as he dies. Atreus\'s grief transforms him into a bear and he battles Kratos before returning to his senses. Thor arrives with Odin, who proposes leaving them alone if Atreus abandons searching for Týr. Kratos refuses and duels Thor to a stalemate. Odin tells Atreus he will leave Kratos alone if the former comes to Asgard. Kratos, Atreus, and Mímir take refuge at Sindri\'s home on a branch of Yggdrasil, and later rescue a pacifistic Týr in Svartalfheim. At Gróa\'s shrine in Alfheim, they learn only Asgard is fated for destruction while other realms survive under a new champion, implied to be Atreus under his Loki identity. Kratos and Atreus argue over the latter\'s supposed destiny.@While asleep, Atreus is transported to Jötunheim where he meets Angrboda, who shows him a mural[b] seemingly foretelling Kratos\'s death in Ragnarök and Atreus serving Odin. Atreus is entrusted with spiritual stones containing Giants\' souls, putting one into a snake\'s body. Atreus returns to Midgard where Freya attacks again but relents, agreeing to spare Kratos if he helps her break the curse binding her to Midgard, which she temporarily circumvents by transforming into a falcon. In Vanaheim, Kratos opens up to Freya about his family\'s deaths in Greece, his vengeance against Olympus, and the emptiness of revenge. After breaking the curse, Freya and Kratos make amends.@Kratos and Atreus argue regarding the latter\'s deceitful behavior, causing Atreus to flee to Asgard to attempt to prevent Kratos\'s death. He works with Thor and Thrúd to prevent Ragnarök by reassembling an ancient mask for Odin that supposedly grants infinite knowledge. Meanwhile, Kratos, Freya, and Mímir visit the Norns who say Heimdall is destined to kill Atreus. Kratos and Brok consequently forge the Draupnir ring into a spear capable of harming Heimdall. In Helheim, Atreus releases the soulless giant wolf Garm, who tears holes between realms. Reunited with Kratos, Atreus resurrects Fenrir by transferring his soul into Garm, and Kratos and Atreus reconcile. In Vanaheim, Kratos is forced to kill Heimdall and claims Gjallarhorn, setting Ragnarök in motion.@Atreus returns to Asgard and assembles the mask before escaping with it. Týr agrees to fight and asks for the mask; suspicious of Týr\'s change of heart, Brok realizes he is calling Atreus \"Loki\", like Asgardians. Týr fatally stabs Brok, revealing himself as Odin in disguise. He is driven away but a grief-stricken Sindri blames Atreus for Brok\'s death and abandons the group. Atreus and Kratos commit to Ragnarök, entering Muspelheim to help Surtr achieve a destined primordial form to destroy Asgard.@The realms\' united forces gather under Kratos\'s leadership; he sounds Gjallarhorn to begin the siege of Asgard. The battle begins poorly: Elves and Vanir struggle with Asgard\'s defenses, Sindri comes alone to avoid more dwarven deaths, and the army is forced to rescue Midgardian refugees. The tides turn when Angrboda arrives with Fenrir and the snake Atreus saved, now grown into Jörmungandr, who battles Thor while Sindri destroys Asgard\'s wall. Thrúd and Sif defect after discovering Odin used refugees as shields. Thor knocks Jörmungandr back in time and battles Kratos, but is convinced to stand down to help his family, only to be killed by Odin for disobeying. Kratos, Atreus, Freya, and Mímir overpower and defeat Odin. Atreus shatters the mask and traps Odin\'s soul in a spiritual stone, which Sindri smashes. Surtr destroys Asgard as the group escapes to Midgard.@Angrboda shows Kratos and Atreus a mural Faye had destroyed so they could determine their own fate. Atreus resolves to find surviving Giants and bids farewell to Kratos, who then discovers a mural depicting himself as a beloved god of peace and justice. Overcome with emotion and finally hopeful about his future, Kratos recruits Freya and Mímir to restore peace. Asgard\'s Einherjar are cleared out, Freya kills the vengeful Valkyrie Queen Gná and reclaims her mantle, the Aesir relocate to Vanaheim and achieve peace with the Vanir, Thrúd wields Mjölnir to honor Thor, and the real Týr is freed in Niflheim.@In the secret ending, Kratos, Freya, Mímir, and an unforgiving Sindri attend Brok\'s funeral in Svartalfheim','https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEIqHfLggaA'),('gta5','Grand Theft Auto 5','In 2004, Michael Townley, Trevor Philips, and Brad Snider partake in a failed robbery in Ludendorff, North Yankton, resulting in Michael being presumed dead. Nine years later, Michael lives with his family in the city of Los Santos under the alias Michael De Santa, having made a secret agreement with the Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Dave Norton to stay hidden. Across town, gangster Franklin Clinton works for a corrupt car salesman and meets Michael while attempting to fraudulently repossess his son\'s car. The two later become friends. When Michael finds his wife sleeping with her tennis coach, he and Franklin chase the coach to a mansion, which Michael destroys in anger. The owner of the mansion, drug lord Martin Madrazo, demands compensation. Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain the money, enlisting Franklin as an accomplice. With the help of Michael\'s old friend Lester Crest, a disabled hacker, they rob a jewellery store to pay off the debt. Meanwhile, Trevor, who lives in squalor on the outskirts of Los Santos, hears of the heist and realises it was Michael\'s work; Trevor had believed the FIB killed Michael in the Ludendorff heist. Trevor finds Michael and reunites with him, forcing Michael to reluctantly accept him back into his life.@As time goes on, the protagonists\' lives spiral out of control. Michael\'s criminal behaviour prompts his family to leave him. When he later becomes a movie producer, he comes into conflict with Devin Weston, a billionaire venture capitalist and corporate raider, who attempts to shut down Michael\'s studio. Michael thwarts his efforts and inadvertently kills his assistant, causing Devin to vow revenge. Meanwhile, Franklin must rescue his friend Lamar Davis from their former friend and rival gangster Harold \"Stretch\" Joseph, who attempts to kill them to prove himself to his new gang. Concurrently, Trevor tries to consolidate his control over various black markets in Blaine County, waging war against The Lost outlaw motorcycle club, Latino street gangs, rival meth dealers, private military company Merryweather, and triad kingpin Wei Cheng.@Having broken his agreement with Dave by committing heists again, Michael is coerced by Dave and his superior, Steve Haines, to perform a series of operations alongside Franklin and Trevor to undermine the International Affairs Agency (IAA). Under Steve\'s direction and with Lester\'s help, they attack a convoy carrying funds for the IAA and steal an experimental chemical weapon from an IAA lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase evidence against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his activities, destroying Steve\'s leverage over him.@After reconciling with his family, Michael starts planning his final heist with Trevor, Franklin, and Lester: raiding the Union Depository\'s gold bullion reserve. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was not imprisoned as he was led to believe, but killed during the Ludendorff heist and buried in the grave marked for Michael. Deducing that the heist was a setup and that he was supposed to be killed in Brad\'s place, Trevor feels betrayed and leaves Michael for dead following a standoff with Cheng\'s henchmen. Although Franklin rescues Michael, Trevor\'s anger towards the latter causes friction within the group and threatens to undermine their plans. Meanwhile, Steve betrays Michael and Dave, and they become caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB, the IAA, and Merryweather. Michael and Dave are rescued by Trevor, who believes only he has the right to kill Michael.@The Union Depository heist is successful, but Franklin is afterwards approached by Steve and Dave, who contend that Trevor is a liability, and Devin, who seeks revenge on Michael. Franklin has three options: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or attempt to save both in a suicide mission. Should Franklin choose to kill either Michael or Trevor, he ceases contact with the man he spares and returns to his old life. Otherwise, the trio, aided by Lamar and Lester, withstands an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Cheng, Stretch, Steve, and Devin. Michael and Trevor reconcile, and the three protagonists cease working together but remain friends.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFj6PmxtL9c'),('mario','Super Mario Bros Wonder','Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy and an entourage of Toads and Yoshis are invited to the neighboring Flower Kingdom by its ruler, Prince Florian, to see a demonstration of a Wonder Flower; great treasures of the Flower Kingdom that can warp reality.

Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli (Kamran Lucas), she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu (Patricia Velásquez), queen of the city. Dominguez is revealed to be the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu\'s brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters strange humanoid monsters identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box, and their leader Crimson Fire.@Lara learns that the Box was taken centuries ago by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. She rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan\'s power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru\'s second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi. The two reunite at an oil refinery and decipher the Box\'s location, a nearby Christian mission established by Lopez.@Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the mission leading to Lopez\'s tomb and the Box. Amaru intercepts them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father\'s death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide.@Back in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex. They plan to disrupt Amaru\'s ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption. Lara is forced to go on alone. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Rourke and the Trinity High Council are slaughtered by the Yaaxil while Lara makes her way to the temple summit. Amaru starts the ritual and absorbs Kukulkan\'s power as the solar eclipse begins. After a lengthy battle, Lara overpowers Amaru and fatally stabs him. Accepting defeat, Amaru transfers Kukulkan\'s power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu\'s warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan\'s spirit and stopping the Cleansing.@In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world\'s mysteries, but to protect them.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2XS_RryJGk'),('zero','Horizon Zero Dawn','Aloy (Ashly Burch) is cast out from the Nora tribe at birth and raised by a fellow outcast named Rost (JB Blanc). As a child (Ava Potter), Aloy obtains a Focus, an augmented reality device that gives her special perceptive abilities. Aloy becomes curious about her origins and is told by Rost that if she wins the Proving, a competition to earn the right to become a member of the Nora, the tribe\'s Matriarchs might concede this information. Aloy spends some years training in combat and survival under Rost\'s instruction.@After coming of age, Aloy participates in the Proving; she wins the competition, but masked cultists attack the Nora. Rost sacrifices himself to save Aloy from their leader, Helis (Crispin Freeman). When Aloy awakens, the Matriarchs explain that Aloy was found as an infant before a sealed door within the Nora\'s sacred mountain and that these suspicious origins were the reason for her being an outcast. The Matriarchs name Aloy a \"Seeker,\" allowing her to leave their lands in pursuit of the cultists. Aloy eventually learns that the cultists are part of a splinter Carja faction called the Eclipse and that Aloy was targeted due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Elisabet Sobeck (also voiced by Burch). Aloy locates the ruined corporate campus of Faro Automated Solutions and discovers that the Old World was destroyed nearly a thousand years ago after Faro lost control of its automated peacekeeper military robots. The robots, which could self-replicate and consume biomass, overran the planet and engulfed the biosphere, stripping Earth of life. Zero Dawn, a project spearheaded by Sobeck, was initiated to create an automated terraforming system to deactivate the robots and restore life to Earth.@Aloy is contacted by Sylens (Lance Reddick), a secretive Banuk figure interested in uncovering the fate of the Old Ones. Aloy learns that Sobeck was sent to a decommissioned Orbital Launch Base to complete Zero Dawn, located under the Citadel, the center of Eclipse power. Inside the base, Aloy learns that Zero Dawn was a vast underground system of databases, factories, and cloning facilities controlled by a single artificial intelligence, GAIA (Lesley Ewen), and her subsystems. Once all life had been extinguished, GAIA developed a countermeasure to deactivate the Faro robots and build her own animalistic machines to restore the Earth\'s biosphere. Once the planet was habitable again, GAIA\'s next goal was to reseed life on Earth based on stored DNA and teach the first human clones not to repeat their predecessors\' mistakes. However, Faro\'s founder and CEO, Theodore Faro, sabotaged APOLLO, the subsystem designed to teach humanity. The new generation of humans was reduced to a tribal, subsistence society. The Eclipse are secretly controlled by HADES (John Gonzalez), another of GAIA\'s subsystems designed to enact controlled extinction if the outcome of Zero Dawn was not favourable for human existence. Reaching Sobeck\'s office, Aloy obtains a registry to give her access to the door beneath the Nora\'s mountain. She is captured by Helis and sentenced to death at the Citadel, but escapes with the help of Sylens. Aloy helps the Nora fight off the Eclipse and unlocks the mountain\'s door.@She finds a recording from GAIA, revealing that a signal of unknown origin caused HADES to activate and seize control of her functions; as a last resort, GAIA self-destructed to stop HADES, but failed and lost control of the other subsystems. Without GAIA to maintain the terraforming process, the entire system began to break down, leading to the Derangement. As a contingency plan, GAIA created a clone of Sobeck in the form of Aloy, hoping she would find GAIA\'s message, destroy HADES, and restore GAIA\'s functions. Aloy learns that Sobeck sacrificed her life to ensure the Faro robots would not find GAIA. Aloy manages to obtain the master override to destroy HADES. Sylens reveals that he founded the Eclipse, initially tempted by HADES\' promises of knowledge when he discovered it. They surmise that HADES intends to send a signal to reactivate the Faro robots to extinguish life on Earth. Aloy kills Helis and helps fight off machines before stabbing HADES and activating the master override, ending the war. She journeys to Sobeck\'s old home, finds her corpse, and mourns her predecessor. In a post-credits scene, HADES is trapped by Sylens, who intends to interrogate HADES to find out who sent the signal that activated it.','https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKLwbkbWQpc');
